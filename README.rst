sphinx-autobuild
================

Watch a Sphinx directory and rebuild the documentation when a change is
detected. Also includes a livereload enabled web server.


Installation
------------

``sphinx-autobuild`` relies on a not-yet-released version of
``python-livereload``. You can install it through pip by issuing the following
command::

    pip install https://github.com/lepture/python-livereload/archive/master.zip

You can then use pip to install the package::

    pip install sphinx-autobuild


Usage
-----

The package installs a single executable script, named ``sphinx-autobuild``.
The script takes the same arguments as the ``sphinx-build`` command installed
by Sphinx plus a ``-p``/``--port`` option to specify the port on which the
documentation shall be served (default 8000).

To build a classical Sphinx documentation set, issue the following command::

    sphinx-autobuild docs docs/_build/html

And then visit the webpage served at http://127.0.0.1:8000. Each time a change
to the documentation source is detected, the HTML is rebuilt and the browser
automatically reloaded.

To stop the server simply press ``^C``.


Makefile integration
--------------------

To integrate the sphinx-autobuild command in the Makefile generated by Sphinx,
add the following target::

    livehtml:
    	sphinx-autobuild -b html $(ALLSPHINXOPTS) $(BUILDDIR)/html

Then run with::

    make livehtml
