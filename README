sphinx-autobuild
================

Watch a Sphinx directory and rebuild the documentation when a change is
detected. Also includes a livereload enabled web server.


Installation
------------

sphinx-autobuild relies on a not-yet-released version of python-livereload.
You can install it through pip by issuing the following command:

    pip install https://github.com/lepture/python-livereload/archive/master.zip

You can then use pip to install the package:

    pip install sphinx-autobuild


Usage
-----

The package installs a single executable script, named sphinx-autobuild.
The script takes the same arguments as the sphinx-build command installed by
Sphinx plus a -p/--port option to specify the port on which the documentation
shall be served (default 8000).

To build a classical Sphinx documentation set, issue the following command:

    sphinx-autobuild docs docs/_build/html

And then visit the webpage served at http://127.0.0.1:8000. Each time a change
to the documentation source is detected, the HTML is rebuilt and the browser
automatically reloaded.

To stop the server simply press ^C.


Makefile integration
--------------------

To integrate the sphinx-autobuild command in the Makefile generated by Sphinx,
add the following target:

    livehtml:
    	sphinx-autobuild -b html $(ALLSPHINXOPTS) $(BUILDDIR)/html
